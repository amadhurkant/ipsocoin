Seeing the way Government of India and other Governments are looking at blockchain and its technologies, as threat to their soverignity,  We (I and every contributor to this project in this github repository 'amadhurkant/ipsocoin') hereby declare:

1. We are in no way responsible or liable on how people are/will using this software.
2. We reaffirm our belief that technology should be used for the good of humanity.
